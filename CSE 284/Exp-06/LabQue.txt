Create class named "Trapezium" with three data members- base1, base2, height and a function
 to calculate the area of trapezium. The class has three constructors which are:
1. Having no paramters - values of both base1, base2 and height are assigned zero.
2. Having three numbers as parameters - the three numbers are assigned as base1, base2 and height
3. Having 2 numbers as parameters - Both bases and heights are assigned those numbers.
Now create objects of the trapezium class having none, three and two parameters 
and print their areas.
