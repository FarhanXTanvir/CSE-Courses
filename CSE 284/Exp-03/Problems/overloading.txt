Function overloading in C++ depends on the following key aspects:

Function Name:
Overloaded functions must have the same name.

    Parameter List:
    The parameter lists of the overloaded functions must differ in at least one of the following ways:
    -Number of parameters
    -Data types of parameters
    -Order of parameters

    Return Type:
    The return type alone is not considered for overloading. Overloaded functions can have different return types.

Scope:
Overloaded functions must be declared within the same scope.

Namespace:
Overloaded functions can be part of the same or different namespaces.
